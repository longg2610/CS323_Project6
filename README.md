# CS 323 - Project 6 : Secure Decision Tree Evaluation

## Project Overview

This program securely evaluates a decision tree with continuous features 
with Secure Multiparty Computation. 
Part 1) Implement Secure Decision Tree Evaluation
Part 2) Test Accuracy with Non-secure and Secure Evaluation of Trained tree 
Part 3) Evaluate Runtime of Trees with Varying Depths

## Project Structure
```

│── dt.py                                    # program file for part 1, part 2, and part 3
│── trained_diabetes_dt.txt                  # text file containing parameters for decision tree trained using scikit

    
```

## Instructions
# Ensure that trained_diabetes_dt.txt is in the same directory as dt.py
